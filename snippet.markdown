# Jala Design Technical Challenge - Backend

The aim of this challenge is for Jala Design to gain an understanding of your capabilities when aligned to the position you have applied for.

## What you'll be creating

At Jala, we â™¥ Table Tennis.

The task is to create a php script that can receive the latest Table Tennis matches and Players and use that data to output information about the tournament.

The functionality which we require is as follows:

- Read in the data from the provided "snippet_data.json" file provided below.
- Create a function that accepts a single player's ID (Please name clearly **getPlayerGames()**) and using the data provided outputs a game log in the following format for **every** game they have played.
- Each game should be output to the log in the following format:
```
Tournament Match  
Score: [Winning Score] : [Losing Score]  
Winner: #[Rank in Tournament based on Wins/Losses] [First Name] [Last Name]  
Loser: #[Rank in Tournament based on Wins/Losses] [First Name] [Last Name]
```

Example with real data:
```
Tournament Match  
Score: 21 - 12  
Winner: #1 Joshua Germon  
Loser: #2 Christian Luntok
```

The requirements have been intentially left with limited comments with the aim for you to expand on the requirements where you see fit.

### Technical Scope

- Clear definition of entry function with ability to adjust input to test other Player IDs.
- Commenting of code to provide insight to other developers.
- All games (win or loss) for said player must be logged in the format above (one after the other).
- Rank of players can be sorted by wins (feel free to ignore losses when calculating rank).

The following is a list of technical skills which link to the generic Jala Design development workflow. This is the tech stack that we would love for you to stick to.
